## Problem PS2.3.1: creating small-world and preferential attachment networks

1.  Create a new R file in the PS2 directory called `{mySUNetID}_networks.R` where you should put in your own SU Net ID before the underscore. For me it'd be `maturner_networks.R`.
2.  Add the following functions to your `{mySUNetID}_networks.R` file:
    1.  `make_smallworld_network`, which will do as it says, create a
       small-world network, starting from a regular lattice network. Use the `socmod.R` in the ProblemSets root directory. Follow the "Small-world network algorithm" on p. 272 of *Modeling Social Behavior* (Smaldino, 2023).   
    2.  `make_preferential_attachment`, following the preferential attachment algorithm on p. 282 of *Modeling Social Behavior.*

## Problem PS2.3.2: calculate average path length, degree distribution, and clustering in various small-world and preferential attachment networks

### 3.2.1: Recreate the classic plot of average path length and clustering

The plot in Figure 9.9 on p. 273 of *Modeling Social Behavior* is a classic one that was originally presented by @Watts1998. Now it is your turn to recreate it. The plot shows how the global clustering coefficient, $C$ (Equation 9.8 on p. 271 in *Modeling Social Behavior*), and the average path length, $L$ (Equation 9.6 on p. 270 in *Modeling Social Behavior*), change as $p$ increases from 0 (unchanged regular lattice) to 1 (fully random).

Note that the x-axis is logarithmic, which can be achieved by specifying `log10` on the x aesthetic in the `ggplot` in the following code block. Edit this block to use your calculations of $L$ and $C$ instead of the fake ones in `fake_smallworld_L_C` the example below.

You will probably want to create one or a few functions to calculate the average path length (using the [`mean_distance` function in igraph](https://igraph.org/r/doc/distances.html)) and the clustering coefficient (using the [`transitivity` function in igraph](https://igraph.org/r/doc/transitivity.html)). 

```{r}
# Create a vector of 20 rewiring probabilities that are
# evenly-spaced on a logarithmic scale from 1/1000 to 1
# using the built-in R function, `seq`.
rewire_probs <- 10^seq(-3.0, 0.0, length.out = 20)

# Set number of networks to generate for each rewire probability.
N_samples <- 20

# Create a column called "Measure" to indicate which of the
# two measures, "L" and "C", the "Value" column corresponds to.
Measure <- as_factor(
  c(rep("L", N_samples*length(rewire_probs)),
    rep("C", N_samples*length(rewire_probs)))
)

# Need to repeat probabilities over N_samples times number of Measures (2).
rewire_probs_col <- rep(rewire_probs, N_samples*2)

# Make fake values drawn from a uniform distribution over (0, 1) for L and (0, 2)
# for C.
N_probs <- length(rewire_probs)
fake_values <- c(runif(N_samples*N_probs), 2*runif(N_samples*N_probs))

fake_smallworld <- tibble(p = rewire_probs_col,
                          Measure = Measure,
                          Value = fake_values)

fake_smallworld_means <- 
  group_by(fake_smallworld, p, Measure) %>%
  summarize(MeanVal = mean(Value))

ggplot(fake_smallworld_means, aes(x=log10(p), y=MeanVal, color=Measure)) + 
  geom_point() +  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-3, -2, -1, 0), 
                     labels=c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0)) +
  theme_classic() 
```


### 3.2.2 Compare degree distributions of 

Create at least two networks with $N=100$ individuals using your small-world network creation function and
one network using the preferential attachment algorithm. One of the small-world
networks should use a smaller rewiring probability (e.g., $p = 0.2$) and the other should 
use a larger rewiring probability (e.g., $p = 0.8$).
Keep $k$ the same for each small-world network so you can inspect the effect of

Plot the degree distributions of each of these three networks, following the
steps shown in the . If there are differences
