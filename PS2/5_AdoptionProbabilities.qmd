\newcommand\pla{{p^{LA}}}

In this exercise we will see how social networks relax the well-mixed
assumption. To do this, we will compare the probability that a person 
doing $L$ observes one doing $A$ under the well-mixed assumption and 
in networked populations. 

randomly-selected
neighbor 
The well-mixed assumption means the probability that an individual $i$ doing $L$ partners with an individual doing $A$ is the same for all $i$:
$$
p_i(L,A) = p_j(L,A) = p(L,A) \text{ for all $i,j$.}
$$
Furthermore, it implies that the mean of $p(L,A)$ across agents is constant over time, and independent of which individuals have adopted the behavior.

Social networks are clearly not well-mixed since individuals in those networks can only learn from network neighbors. But what is the distribution, exactly, of $\Pr(L,A)$? For fun let's consider an anachronistic example where some of the Florentine oligarchy start to install solar panels. Let's pretend
that if families have intermarried, then they might communicate about solar
panel installation with one another. If there's no intermarriage, they don't
talk about sustainable adaptations. Then we can use the marriage social network
as a communication network for sustainable adaptation diffusion.

## Problem 2.5.1: $\Pr(L,A)$ in different network structures 

Create the networks in the following lists with $N=100$ and $A = 25$. 
For each of the following, how does the distribution of $\Pr(L,A)$ change? 

1. Regular lattices with 
   - $k=10=N/10$ 
   - $k=50=N/2$


## Problem 2.5.2: Plot mean probability of exposure for all agents doing $L$ 

Call the mean probability of exposure the expected value of $\plai$
